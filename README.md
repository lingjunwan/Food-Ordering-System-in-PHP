# Food-Ordering-System-in-PHP
### Project MissionEats is a web-based online food ordering System where anyone may register and place orders.  
It enables the administrator who is logged in to maintain the menus by using the CRUD operation and shows clients a list of the available food products together with their prices so that they may place an order after selecting what they want from the menu.  
It is developed in PHP and MySQL is used to store the database.  
CSS and Bootstrap are also used to enhance the UI of the website.  
This system can be used for any restaurant for its online services.  
### It's a website that's compatible with mobile devices.  
It is developed with mobile users in mind and as such very responsive which gives mobile users the same sleek GUI and function as the web users.
